# SayLess AI - Authentication & Paywall Implementation Plan

**Author**: Manus AI
**Date**: January 8, 2025
**Version**: 1.2

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing user authentication and Stripe-based payment processing in the SayLess AI application. The plan transforms the current client-only application into a full-stack SaaS platform while maintaining the privacy-first approach and local speech processing capabilities.

## Known Issues
- The real-time filler word detection for "uh" and "um" is not always accurate and can miss instances of these words. This is a high-priority bug to be addressed.

## Project Structure Overview
Here is the high-level overview of the project structure as it stands now, including the recent refactoring:

*   **`src/`**: This is the main folder for all our application's source code.
    *   **`main.jsx`**: The entry point of the React application.
    *   **`App.jsx`**: The top-level component. After the refactoring, it's much cleaner. Its main job is to manage the application's overall state and compose the main UI components together.
    *   **`components/`**: This directory holds all the reusable UI components.
        *   **`SessionControl.jsx`**, **`RecordingStatus.jsx`**, **`FillerWordCounters.jsx`**: These are the new components created to break down the main UI into logical, manageable parts.
        *   **`AnalyticsDashboard.jsx`**: The component for the user's analytics dashboard (currently using mock data).
        *   **`ErrorDisplay.jsx`**: A new, dedicated component for showing errors consistently.
        *   **`ui/`**: This holds the primitive UI components from `shadcn/ui` (like `Button`, `Card`, etc.).
    *   **`hooks/`**: This is where the application's core logic lives.
        *   **`useSpeechRecognition.js`**: Manages the Web Speech API and the logic for detecting filler words.
        *   **`useAudioRecording.js`**: Manages the microphone recording state.
    *   **`config.js`**: The new centralized configuration file. It holds shared settings (like the speech recognition language) and constants, making the code more robust and easier to update.
*   **`README.md`**: The project documentation file.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts (like `npm test`).
*   **`vite.config.js`** & **`vitest.config.js`**: Configuration files for the Vite build tool and the Vitest test runner.
*   **`tailwind.config.cjs`** & **`postcss.config.cjs`**: Configuration files for the Tailwind CSS framework.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Next.js Migration
- Migrate from Vite/React to Next.js 15 with App Router
- Preserve existing UI components and styling (Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui)
- Implement proper TypeScript configuration
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality

#### 1.2 Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Users table (managed by Supabase Auth)
-- Sessions table
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  duration INTEGER, -- in seconds
  total_words INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  filler_word_counts JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  transcript TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Subscription plans table
CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price_monthly INTEGER, -- in cents
  price_yearly INTEGER, -- in cents
  features JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  max_sessions_per_month INTEGER,
  max_session_duration INTEGER, -- in minutes
  stripe_price_id_monthly VARCHAR(255),
  stripe_price_id_yearly VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User subscriptions table
CREATE TABLE user_subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  plan_id UUID REFERENCES subscription_plans(id),
  stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50), -- active, canceled, past_due, etc.
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 1.3 Supabase Configuration

interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  loading: boolean;
  signIn: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signUp: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  signOut: () => Promise<void>;
  resetPassword: (email: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits application
2. Check authentication state via Supabase client
3. Redirect to login if unauthenticated
4. Handle OAuth callbacks for social logins
5. Store user session in secure HTTP-only cookies
6. Implement automatic token refresh

### Payment Flow
1. User selects subscription plan
2. Redirect to Stripe Checkout or use Stripe Elements
3. Handle successful payment webhook
4. Update user subscription status in database
5. Grant access to premium features
6. Send confirmation email

### Session Data Flow
1. User starts recording session (client-side)
2. Process speech recognition locally (privacy maintained)
3. The raw audio from a user's session is processed in real-time and is never stored on the server. Users will be given an option to download their recording before the session ends.
4. Save session metadata (transcript, filler word counts) to database for users on a Pro plan or higher.
5. Sync session history across devices.
6. Provide analytics and insights based on saved session data.

### Security Considerations
- Implement CSRF protection
- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Validate all API inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use Supabase RLS for data access control
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement React Query for efficient data fetching
- Use Next.js Image optimization
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Use CDN for static assets

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Development: Local Next.js with Supabase local development
- Staging: Vercel preview deployments with Supabase staging
- Production: Vercel production with Supabase production

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Automated deployment to Vercel on merge to main
- Database migrations via Supabase CLI
- Environment variable management

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- PostHog for user analytics and error tracking
- Stripe Dashboard for payment monitoring

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
- Export existing user preferences (if any)
- Migrate to new authentication system
- Preserve user experience during transition

### Feature Flag Implementation
- Gradual rollout of new features
- A/B testing for pricing strategies
- Fallback mechanisms for critical features

### User Communication
- Email notifications about new features
- In-app announcements
- Documentation updates
- Support channel preparation

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
