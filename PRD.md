## 3. Proposed Architecture (MVP)
The MVP stack is chosen for speed and low initial cost.

| Component | Tech Stack | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | **React + Vite** (on Vercel) | Fast, simple, and cheap to host. |
| Authentication | **Clerk** | Handles user sign-up, login, and management with minimal setup. |
| Payment Processing | **Stripe Checkout** | Easiest way to implement subscriptions without a dedicated backend. |
| Local Storage | Browser `localStorage` | Persists user data and session history on the client-side for the MVP. |
| Analytics | **Vercel Analytics** | Basic, free analytics to track user engagement. |


## 4. Privacy & Security Requirements
- **No storage of audio or transcripts**.
- Only filler word counts and timestamps are stored for registered users.
- **Explicit user consent** is required for any cloud-based processing.
- All API requests must be validated. Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for sessions.
- CSRF protection and rate limiting should be considered post-launch.

## 5. Cost Breakdown (MVP)
| Service | Free Tier | Cost After Free |
|---|---|---|
| **Vercel** | 100GB bandwidth | $20/month |
| **Clerk** | 5,000 MAU | $25/month |
| **Stripe** | No monthly fee | 2.9% + $0.30/txn |
| **Domain** | N/A | $12/year |
| **Total Month 1** | **$0** | |
| **Total at scale** | | **~$77/month** (for ~1000 users) |

## 6. Development Roadmap (3-Week MVP)
The development will follow an aggressive 4-week timeline to launch a monetizable "Smart MVP". The detailed, day-by-day plan is available in the `smart-mvp-plan.md` document.

- **Week 1 (Days 1-7):** Focus on core functionality, including enhanced error handling, browser compatibility checks, and robust local storage management.
- **Week 2 (Days 8-14):** Implement user authentication with Clerk, usage tracking for the free tier, and a Stripe-powered paywall.
- **Week 3 (Days 15-21):** Build out the payment success/cancellation pages, enhance the analytics dashboard with existing data, and prepare for production deployment on Vercel.

## 7. Success Metrics & Launch Goals

### **Week 1 Goals:**
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Zero browser crashes
- ✅ Mobile-responsive UI

### **Week 2 Goals:**
- ✅ User can sign up/login
- ✅ Usage limits enforced
- ✅ Payment flow working

### **Week 3 Goals:**
- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ First paying customer possible
- ✅ Analytics tracking users

### **30-Day Post-Launch Targets:**
- 100 trial users
- 10 paying customers ($50-100 MRR)
- <5% error rate

## 8. Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks:**
1. **Clerk integration issues** → Mitigation: Extensive testing during development.
2. **Payment failures** → Mitigation: Thoroughly test with Stripe's test mode before launch.
3. **Mobile browser issues** → Mitigation: Test on at least 3 different mobile devices/browsers.

### **Business Risks:**
1. **No user interest** → Mitigation: Offer a strong free tier (5 minutes) to attract users.
2. **Price resistance** → Mitigation: Be prepared to A/B test pricing post-launch.
3. **Competition** → Mitigation: Emphasize the privacy-first angle as a key differentiator.
