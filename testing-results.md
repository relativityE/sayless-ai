# SpeakSharp Testing Results

## Functionality Verification

### Architecture
- The application has been refactored to use a "progressive reveal" model.
- The `ProtectedRoute` component has been removed, and all pages are now publicly accessible.
- Page content and features are now conditionally rendered based on the user's authentication status.

### Anonymous User Flow
1.  **Public Access**: All pages (`/`, `/session`, `/analytics`) are accessible to anonymous users.
2.  **Header UI**: The header correctly displays "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons.
3.  **Session Page**: The 2-minute trial limit is enforced, with a developer override checkbox available. Sessions are not saved.
4.  **Analytics Page**: A call-to-action page is displayed, prompting users to sign up. It includes a disabled preview of the dashboard.

### Authenticated User Flow
1.  **Header UI**: The header correctly displays user-specific links ("Analytics", "Logout").
2.  **Session Page**: The 2-minute time limit is removed. Sessions are correctly saved.
3.  **Analytics Page**: The user's session history and analytics are correctly displayed.

## Test Suite
- The entire test suite has been updated to reflect the new architecture.
- Tests for `App.jsx` now confirm that all routes are public.
- A new test file, `AnalyticsPage.test.jsx`, was created to test the conditional rendering of the page for both anonymous and authenticated users.
- After several iterations of fixes, all **19 tests** in the suite are now passing.

## Conclusion
- The application is now fully aligned with the product requirements for a "progressive reveal" user flow.
- The implementation is robust and has been thoroughly verified by an updated test suite.
