# SpeakSharp Testing Results

## Functionality Verification

### Build & Dependency Issues
- The dependency resolution issues with `@supabase/supabase-js` have been fixed by cleaning all lockfiles and `node_modules`, updating the Vite configuration, and performing a clean `pnpm install`. The application now starts correctly.

### Anonymous User Flow
1.  **Public Access**: Users can now access the main page (`/`) and the session page (`/session`) without being logged in.
2.  **Header UI**: The header correctly displays "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons for anonymous users.
3.  **Trial Timer**: The session page correctly implements a 2-minute (120-second) recording limit for anonymous users. The UI displays the time limit.
4.  **Session Handling**: When an anonymous session ends (either by timer or by clicking "End Session"), the recording stops, but the session is not saved, and the user is not redirected to the analytics page. This is correct.
5.  **Protected Routes**: The `/analytics` page remains protected and correctly redirects anonymous users to the `/auth` page.


### Authenticated User Flow
1.  **Header UI**: The header correctly displays the user's email, an "Analytics" link, and a "Logout" button for authenticated users.
2.  **Session Handling**: Authenticated users can start sessions without a time limit. When a session is ended, it is correctly saved, and the user is redirected to the analytics page.

## Issues Found & Next Steps
- **Microphone Access**: Full testing of audio-dependent features (transcription, filler word detection) is not possible due to the sandbox environment's limitations.
- **Auth Page UI**: The user has requested that the authentication page (`/auth`) be redesigned to match the application's overall theme. This will be handled as a separate step.

## Conclusion
- The core functionality for both anonymous and authenticated users is working as expected according to the `PRD.md`.
- The application is now aligned with the user flow for the "Anonymous Free Trial".
