# SayLess AI Testing Results

## Functionality Verification

### Installation:
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` was successful.

### Running the Application:
- `npm run dev` successfully started the development server on `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Core Features Testing (as per README.md):
1. **Start New Session**: Clicking "Start New Session" button successfully transitions the UI to the recording interface.
2. **Start Recording**: Clicking "Start Recording" button triggers a microphone permission request. If permissions are not granted, an error message "Failed to start recording. Please check microphone permissions." is displayed. This is expected behavior as the sandbox environment does not have microphone access.
3. **Filler Word Detection**: Cannot fully test filler word detection as microphone access is required. The UI elements for filler word counts are present and appear to be ready to update, but without audio input, they remain at zero.
4. **Session Timer**: The session timer starts counting up after clicking "Start Recording".
5. **Live Transcript Display**: Cannot fully test live transcript display as microphone access is required.

## Issues Found:
- **Microphone Access**: The primary issue is the lack of microphone access within the sandbox environment, which prevents full testing of the audio capture, speech-to-text transcription, and filler word detection features. This is an environmental limitation, not a bug in the application code.

## Conclusion:
- The SayLess AI application appears to be correctly implemented based on the available testing capabilities within the sandbox. The UI responds as expected, and error handling for microphone permissions is in place. Full functional testing of audio-dependent features is not possible in this environment.
