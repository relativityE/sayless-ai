# SpeakSharp Testing Results

## Functionality Verification

### Installation:
- `pnpm install` was successful. The previous issue with `@supabase/supabase-js` failing to resolve has been fixed.
- The fix involved a multi-step process:
  1. Deleting `node_modules`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and the extraneous `package-lock.json`.
  2. Updating `vite.config.js` to include `@supabase/supabase-js` in the `optimizeDeps.include` array to help Vite with dependency resolution when using pnpm.
  3. Performing a clean install with `pnpm install`.

### Running the Application:
- `pnpm run dev` successfully started the development server on `http://localhost:5173/`. The import error for `@supabase/supabase-js` no longer occurs.

### Core Features Testing (as per README.md):
1. **Start New Session**: Clicking "Start New Session" button successfully transitions the UI to the recording interface.
2. **Start Recording**: Clicking "Start Recording" button triggers a microphone permission request. If permissions are not granted, an error message "Failed to start recording. Please check microphone permissions." is displayed. This is expected behavior as the sandbox environment does not have microphone access.
3. **Filler Word Detection**: Cannot fully test filler word detection as microphone access is required. The UI elements for filler word counts are present and appear to be ready to update, but without audio input, they remain at zero.
4. **Session Timer**: The session timer starts counting up after clicking "Start Recording".
5. **Live Transcript Display**: Cannot fully test live transcript display as microphone access is required.

## Issues Found:
- **Microphone Access**: The primary issue is the lack of microphone access within the sandbox environment, which prevents full testing of the audio capture, speech-to-text transcription, and filler word detection features. This is an environmental limitation, not a bug in the application code.

## Conclusion:
- The SpeakSharp application's dependency and build issues are now resolved. The application starts correctly.
- The UI responds as expected for non-audio features, and error handling for microphone permissions is in place. Full functional testing of audio-dependent features is not possible in this environment.
